#
# This file defines a schema for validating the "tables" config which determines table-specific behaviour.
# The file format is YAML for readability & comment support, but it is actually following the JSON
# schema standard: https://json-schema.org/.
#

# The top-level consists of keys for the name of each table you want to configure.
